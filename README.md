# mbpoll

## Abstract

mbpoll is a command line utility to communicate with ModBus slave (RTU or TCP).  
This is a multiplatform project, the compilation was tested on GNU Linux
x86, x86_64, armhf and arm64 (Armbian/Raspbian), Microsoft Windows, and Mac OSX.  

Development of major version 1 of mbpoll is complete, **version 2 using libmodbuspp is under development.** Proposals for new features will be transferred to this new branch.

mbpoll can:

- read discrete inputs
- read and write binary outputs (*coil*)
- read input registers
- read and write output registers (*holding register*)

The reading and writing registers may be in decimal, hexadecimal or 
floating single precision.

> **Note:** mbpoll's output syntax and command line option syntax is similar to the original modpoll command line program published by proconX. However mbpoll is a completely independent project and based on different source code than the original modpoll program. mbpoll is distributed under the GPL license, but the original modpoll program is not covered by the GPL license.


## Quickstart guide

The fastest and safest way to install mbpoll is to use the APT 
repository from [piduino.org](http://apt.piduino.org), so you should do the following :

    wget -O- http://www.piduino.org/piduino-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://apt.piduino.org stretch piduino'
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mbpoll

This repository provides `mbpoll` and `libmodbus` (version 3.1.4) packages for 
`i386`, `amd64`, `armhf` and `arm64` architectures.
In the above commands, the repository is a Debian Stretch distribution, but you 
can also choose Ubuntu Trusty, Xenial or Bionic by replacing `stretch` with 
`trusty`, `xenial` or `bionic`.  
It may be necessary to install the `software-properties-common` 
package for `add-apt-repository`.

For Raspbian you have to do a little different :

    wget -O- http://www.piduino.org/piduino-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    echo 'deb http://raspbian.piduino.org stretch piduino' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/piduino.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mbpoll

The Raspbian repository provides Piduino packages for `armhf` architecture for Stretch only.

## Installation using Brew on MacOS and Linux
Using [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) to install mbpoll and its dependencies using:

`brew install mbpoll`


## Build from source

For example, for a debian system:

* Install [libmodbus](https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus.git) (Version >= 3.1.4) :

        $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool git-core autoconf automake
        $ git clone https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus.git
        $ cd libmodbus
        $ ./autogen.sh
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

You can also install it with `apt` if the version of libmodbus is greater than or equal to 3.1.4.
For example to query a debian system:

    $ apt-cache show libmodbus-dev

* Install [piduino](https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino/tree/dev) **only if you want to manage the RS485 with a GPIO signal**:

        $ sudo apt-get install cmake libcppdb-dev pkg-config libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libudev-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino.git
        $ cd piduino 
        $ git checkout dev
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
    
* Generate Makefile with cmake:

        $ sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config
        $ cd mbpoll
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..

* Compile and install mbpoll:

        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo ldconfig

If you prefer, you can in the place of direct compilation create a package and install it:

        $ make package
        $ sudo dpkg -i * .deb

In some cases, when installing pkg-config for the first time, it may be necessary to set the $PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable before running CMAKE, so pkg_check_module it will be able to find the libmodbus at /usr/local/lib/ directory. This can be done by the following command: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Make sure to adjust the path /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig if your pkgconfig is located in a different path.

That's all !

For Windows, you can follow the instructions in the [README-WINDOWS.md](README-WINDOWS.md) file.

## Shell Completion

### Zsh

A Zsh completion script is available for `mbpoll`, enabling advanced tab completion for all options and arguments.

- If you use CMake `make install`, the script `contrib/_mbpoll` will be installed to your system's zsh site-functions directory (typically `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions`).
- If you install manually, copy `contrib/_mbpoll` to a directory in your `$fpath`. Then restart your shell or run:
  ```sh
  autoload -Uz compinit
  compinit
  ```
- Type `mbpoll <TAB>` in Zsh to enjoy completions!

### Bash

A Bash completion script is also provided.

- If you use CMake `make install`, the script `contrib/mbpoll.bash` will be installed to your system's bash-completion directory (typically `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`).
- If you install manually, copy `contrib/mbpoll.bash` to `/etc/bash_completion.d/` or `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`.
- Restart your shell or run:
  ```sh
  source /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/mbpoll
  ```
- Now, typing `mbpoll <TAB>` in Bash will complete options and arguments.

### Note for Distributions

If your system uses a different completion directory, set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` or adjust the install location as needed.

## Examples

The following command is used to read the input registers 1 and 2 of the
slave at address 33 connected through RTU /dev/ttyUSB2 (38400 Bd)
